Footnote(s): Data for 2022 are considered preliminary (subject to a 12-month reporting delay). Inclusion of 2022 data in trend assessments is discouraged. Data for the year 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to HIV testing, care-related services, and case surveillance activities in state/local jurisdictions. Data by transmission category presented based on assigned sex at birth and are adjusted for missing transmission category. See Technical notes for more details on data availability and stratifications.
The 'Sex' column is used for either sex at birth or gender identity.
NA - Not applicable.
